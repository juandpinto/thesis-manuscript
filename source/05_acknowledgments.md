# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

First and foremost, I'd like to thank my graduate advisor, Dr. Esther Raizen. Without our early Skype conversations and your willingness to put together a customized program to suit my interests, I likely would have never ended up in Austin. Thank you for sharing your passion for language education, pedagogy, and research with me. I owe also an immense gratitude to Dr. Elaine Horwitz, who has opened up the world of second language acquisition to me, and who has probably had more of an influence on the direction of my future career than any other person.

I'm also indebted to all of the wonderful professors I have had the opportunity to learn from these last two years. To my professors of Biblical Hebrew, Drs. John Huehnergard, Jo Ann Hackett, and Na'ama Pat-El, thank you for putting up with the intruder in your classes who got to sip from your vast reservoirs of knowledge. To Dr. Thomas Garza, thank you for being such an incredibly encouraging mentor and for helping me gain confidence in my own abilities and in my future prospects.

Lastly, I owe my gratitude, sanity, and perseverance to my family. To my wife, Jaime, thank you for joyfully sticking by my side, even when that has meant living under the brutal Texas sun. To my children, thank you for filling my heart to overflowing each day. To my parents, thank you for always believing in me.
