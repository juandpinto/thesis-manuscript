  abstract = {This study focused on the relationship between percentage of vocabulary known in a text and level of comprehension of the same text. Earlier studies have estimated the percentage of vocabulary necessary for second language learners to understand written texts as being between 95\% (Laufer, 1989) and 98\% (Hu \& Nation, 2000). In this study, 661 participants from 8 countries completed a vocabulary measure based on words drawn from 2 texts, read the texts, and then completed a reading comprehension test for each text. The results revealed a relatively linear relationship between the percentage of vocabulary known and the degree of reading comprehension. There was no indication of a vocabulary "threshold," where comprehension increased dramatically at a particular percentage of vocabulary knowledge. Results suggest that the 98\% estimate is a more reasonable coverage target for readers of academic texts.},

The articles included in this literature review look into the understand- ing of vocabulary learning through incidental means, the relationship of reading and incidental vo- cabulary learning, and the strategies and tasks that promote the incidental learning of vocabulary. The findings show that L2 learners develop much of their vocabulary by incidental means through expo- sure to words in informative contexts. Moreover, this exposure is promoted by reading, and enhanced through multimodal glosses. Further research may focus on listening for higher lexical retention rates, the circumstances that allow incidental learning of multi-word phrases and collocations, and the use of technology-based methods for incidental vocabulary acquisition.},

  abstract = {The high-frequency vocabulary of English has traditionally been thought to consist of the 2,000 most frequent word families, and low-frequency vocabulary as that beyond the 10,000 frequency level. This paper argues that these boundaries should be reassessed on pedagogic grounds. Based on a number of perspectives (including frequency and acquisition studies, the amount of vocabulary necessary for English usage, the range of graded readers, and dictionary defining vocabulary), we argue that high-frequency English vocabulary should include the most frequent 3,000 word families. We also propose that the low-frequency vocabulary boundary should be lowered to the 9,000 level, on the basis that 8\textendash{}9,000 word families are sufficient to provide the lexical resources necessary to be able to read a wide range of authentic texts (Nation 2006). We label the vocabulary between high-frequency (3,000) and low-frequency (9,000+) as mid-frequency vocabulary. We illustrate the necessity of mid-frequency vocabulary for proficient language use, and make some initial suggestions for research addressing the pedagogical challenge raised by mid-frequency vocabulary.},

The coverage of four spoken informal narrative passages was manipulated, and participants' (36 native and 40 non-native speakers) listening comprehension of factual information was measured. Results showed that most native and non-native participants could adequately comprehend the spoken texts with only 90 per cent coverage, although the non-natives showed considerable variation at this level. At 95 per cent coverage, non-native participants also demonstrated relatively good comprehension, but with much less variation.

The AWL contains 570 word families that account for approximately 10.0\% of the total words (tokens) in academic texts but only 1.4\% of the total words in a fiction collection of the same size. This difference in coverage provides evidence that the list contains predominantly academic words. By highlighting the words that university students meet in a wide range of academic texts, the AWL shows learners with academic goals which words are most worth studying.

The authors compared the reading-comprehension, word-decoding, and oral- language skills of both high and low SES Dutch third and fourth graders to the skills of low SES minority third and fourth graders from a Turkish or Moroccan background living in the Netherlands. Several tests of reading comprehension, word decoding, oral text comprehension, morphosyntactic knowledge, and vocabulary knowledge were administered at the beginning of third grade, the end of third grade, and the end of fourth grade. The results showed the minority children to be faster decoders than the Dutch low SES children. With respect to reading comprehension and oral language proficiency, however, the minority children were found to lag behind the Dutch children in all respects. With respect to the interrelations between oral-language skills and reading skills, the development of reading comprehension was found to be influenced more by top-down comprehension- based processes than by bottom-up word-decoding processes for both the first- and second-language learners. The oral Dutch skills of the minority children played a more prominent role in the explanation of their reading- comprehension skills than the oral-language skills of the Dutch children, however. /// [Spanish] El prop{\'o}sito del presente estudio fue investigar el desarrollo y las interrelaciones de las habilidades ling{\"u}{\'\i}sticas y lectoras en ni{\~n}os que aprenden a leer, ya sea en su lengua materna o en una segunda lengua.

Die Autoren verglichen das Leseverst{\"a}ndnis, die Wortentshl{\"u}sselunung und die m{\"u}ndlichen Sprachfertigkeiten von jeweils hohen und unteren holl{\"a}dischen SES Dritt- und Viertkl{\"a}sslern mit den Fertigkeiten von in Holland lebenden t{\"u}rkischen oder marokkanischen Minorit{\"a}ten von unteren SES Dritt- und Viertkl{\"a}sslern. Verschiedene Tests des Leseverstandnisses, der Wortentschl{\"u}sselung, m{\"u}ndlichem Textverst{\"a}ndnis, morphosyntaktischem Wissen, und der Vokabelbeherrschung wurden am Anfang der dritten Klasse, am Ende der dritten Klasse, und am ; Ende der vierten Klasse angewandt. In den Ergebnissen enviesen sich die Kinder aus den Minderheiten als die schnelleren Enaifferer gegen{\"u}ber den holl{\"a}ndischen unteren SES Kindern. Jedoch stellte sich beim Leseverst{\"a}ndnis und der m{\"u}ndlichen Sprachfertigkeir heraus, dass die Minorit{\"a}tskinder {\"u}berall hinter den holl{\"a}ndischen Kindern zur{\"u}ckblieben. Bez{\"u}glich der Wechselbeziehungen zwischen m{\"u}ndlichen Sprachkennrnissen und Lesefertigkeiten, sowie bei der Entwicklung vom Leseverst{\"a}ndnis fand sich die Einflu$\beta$nahme mehr basierend auf die von oben-nach-unten reichenden Verst{\"a}ndnisprozesse, start durch unten-nach-oben verlaufende Prozesse der Wortentschl{\"u}sselung f{\"u}r beide, sowohl Erst- als auch Zweitsprachen-Erlerner. Die m{\"u}ndlichen Aussprachekenntnisse der Minorit{\"a}tskinder im Holl{\"a}ndischen spielten jedoch eine hervorstechendere Rolle bei der Erkl{\"a}rung ihrer Beherrschung des Leseverst{\"a}ndnisses, als bei den m{\"u}ndlichen Sprachkenntnissen holl{\"a}ndischer Kinder. /// [Japanese] 本研究の目的は、第 1 言語または第2言語で読 むことを学んでいる子供 達の言語熟達度とリー デ イングカの発達及び その相互関係を調査す ることであった。ここ では、読解力、語の解 読力、口 頭言語技能を 、オランダ人で社会経 済的地位が高い3 、4 年 生とそれが低い3 、4 年 生の両方、 そして、 トルコやモロッコ出身 で、オランダ在住の社 会的経済地位が低いマ イノリティ ーの3 、 4 年生とで比較した。第 3 学年の最初と最後、そ して第4学年の最後に、 読解力、語の解読力、 口頭テキストの理解力 、形態素及び統語に関 する知識、そして語業 知識を計るテストが幾 つか実 施された。その 結果、マイノリティー の子供達は、社会経済 的地位の低いオランダ 人の子供達より、語の 解読が速いことが示さ れた。しかしながら、 読解力と口頭言語熟達 度に関しては、あら ゆる点において、マイ ノリティーの子供達が オランダ人の子供達に 遅れを取っていること が分かった。口頭言 語技能とリーディング 技能の相互関係に関し ては、読解力の発達が 、第1 言語と第 2言語学習者の両方で、 ボトムアップな単語解 読プロセスよりトップ ダウンな理解を基\&\#76E4;と するプロセスに強く 影響されていることが 示された．しかし、マ イノリティーの子供達 の口頭オラン ダ語技能 は、オランダ人の子供 達の口頭言語技能より 、読解技能の説明にお いてより重要な役割 を果たしていた。 /// [French] Cette recherche avait pour but d'examiner le d{\'e}veloppement et les interrelations entre les comp{\'e}tences langagi{\`e}res et la ma{\^\i}trise de la lecture d'enfants apprenant {\`a} lire dans leur langue maternelle ou dans une langue etrangkre. Les auteurs ont compar{\'e} la compr{\'e}hension de la lecture, le d{\'e}codage de mots et les comp{\'e}tences en langue parl{\'e}e d'enfants hollandais de troisi{\`e}me et quatri{\`e}me ann{\'e}e de milieu social favoris{\'e} et d{\'e}favoris{\'e} aux comp{\'e}tences d'enfants de troisi{\`e}me et quatri{\`e}me ann{\'e}e de minorit{\'e}s de milieu social d{\'e}favoris{\'e} d'origine marocaine et turque.

Les r{\'e}sultats ont montr{\'e} que les enfants des minorit{\'e}s d{\'e}codent plus rapidement que les enfants hollandais de milieu social d{\'e}favoris{\'e}. En ce qui concerne cependant la compr{\'e}hension de la lecture et la langue parl{\'e}e, les enfants des minorit{\'e}s sont inf{\'e}rieurs aux enfants hollandais de tous les points de vue. En ce qui concerne les interrelations entre les comp{\'e}tences en langue parl{\'e}e et la ma{\^\i}trise de la lecture, il est apparu que le d{\'e}veloppement de la compr{\'e}hension de la lecture depend plus des processus de compr{\'e}hension de haut en bas que des processus de d{\'e}codage, aussi bien pour les apprenants de langue maternelle que pour ceux de langue {\'e}trang{\`e}re. Cependant, le niveau en hollandais parl{\'e} des enfants des minorit{\'e}s joue un r{\'o}le plus important dans l'explication de leur niveau de compr{\'e}hension de la lecture que ce n'est le cas pour

A total of 110 intermediate to advanced ESL learners participated; comprehension of a short news text was tested under two conditions, Names Known (all proper names pre-taught in advance) and Names Unknown (all proper names unfamiliar prior to listening). The Names Known group performed significantly better than the Names Unknown group on two measures, true-false-don?t know statements and open-ended questions. The effect of unfamiliar proper names on comprehension remained statistically significant after the listening proficiency variable was controlled. Listeners in the Names Unknown treatment were able to derive 44.8\% of information about the referents of proper names from context but they could not identify all the referents successfully. Unfamiliar proper names evidently hinder comprehension, which was also supported by the participants? task difficulty ratings. When proper names were familiar, participants rated all comprehension tasks as easier to do and self-reported higher comprehension success. In contrast, when proper names were unfamiliar, participants rated all comprehension tasks as harder to do and self-reported a lower amount of comprehension.It has long been established that vocabulary knowledge is a prerequisite to successful comprehension. This study confirms that, similarly to common vocabulary, the presence of unfamiliar proper names decreases the ESL learners? chances of understanding spoken English. Implications of the findings for second language learning and testing are discussed.It is recommended that teachers be flexible when setting up listening exercises and use different techniques depending on the depth of understanding the learners are supposed to achieve. If the instructional goal is listening for gist, proper names will unlikely affect the outcomes of the activity. However, if detailed and precise understanding is required, then it is unrealistic to expect ESL listeners to cope with unfamiliar proper names ?on the spot? without assistance or preparation. It is also advisable to avoid unfamiliar proper names in a testing situation because they may cause unwarranted anxiety and reflect negatively on the ESL listeners? performance.},

The four corpora were selected to represent a variety of corpus sizes and approaches to representativeness and sampling. In particular, the study investigates the lexical overlap among the corpora in the top 3,000 words based on the average reduced frequency (ARF), which is a measure that takes into consideration both frequency and dispersion of lexical items. The results show that there exists a stable vocabulary core of 2,122 items (70.7\%) among the four corpora. Moreover, these vocabulary items occur with comparable ranks in the individual wordlists. In producing the new-GSL, the core vocabulary items were combined with new items frequently occurring in the corpora representing current language use (BE06 and EnTenTen12). The final product of the study, the new-GSL, consists of 2,494 lemmas and covers between 80.1 and 81.7 per cent of the text in the source corpora.},

The five years of data collection involved English language instruction in high school and university. Test scores were examined according to the amount of English language instruction the participants received. The results indicated that one group of participants learned as few as 18 words in one year, while another group learned as many as 430 words. The findings also revealed that in the final year of the study only 47\% of the participants had mastered the 1,000 word level, and 16\% had mastered the 2,000 word level. The results suggest that vocabulary learning within the institution could be greatly improved. Key features of a vocabulary learning plan within institutions are outlined.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate the growth of recognition vocabulary during the early and middle elementary school years in relation to the development of morphological knowledge. Six-, 8-, and 10- year-old children from grades 1, 3, and 5 (32 children at each age/grade level) were tested for their knowledge of a relatively large sample of main entry words drawn from a recent unabridged nonhistorical dictionary of the English language. Analyses of the sample of words indicated that it was reasonably representative of the main entry words in the entire dictionary in terms of frequency of occurrence and in terms of the distribution of the words according to morphological type. The children were tested on the words by means of definition, sentence, and multiple-choice questions. By multiplying the proportion of known words in the sample by the number of main entry words in the dictionary, estimates of total main entry recognition vocabulary knowledge were derived suggesting remarkable growth of vocabulary knowledge during the early and middle elementary school years. The focus of the present study, however, was on the contribution made by different morphologically defined word types and by knowledge of morphology and word formation to total recognition vocabulary at different age and grade levels. It was found that comprehension of derived words in particular improved dramatically between grades 1 and 5, contributing relatively little to total recognition vocabulary in grade 1, but contributing more to such knowledge than any other morphologically defined type of word by grade 5. Moreover, it was found that multimorphemic words- words consisting of three or more morphemes-were also associated with particular growth, being not well known in grade 1 but being relatively much better known by grade 5. This is interpreted as supporting the view that lexical development can be characterized in terms of increasing morphological complexity. Further, it was found that the proportion of known complex words for which there was evidence that children figured them out by analyzing their morphological structure increased with age and grade. Qualifications regarding this latter finding are discussed, but it is argued that the data indicate the importance of making a distinction between knowing words because they have been previously learned and knowing them by means of morphological analysis and composition, particularly when trying to interpret the dramatic growth in recognition vocabulary suggested by this and related studies.},

The paper distinguishes among various ways that linguistic features can be distributed within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of several particular features, and it discusses the implications of these distributions for corpus design.The paper argues that theoretical research should be prior in corpus design, to identify the situational parameters that distinguish among texts in a speech community, and to identify the types of linguistic features that will be analysed in the corpus. These theoretical considerations should be complemented by empirical investigations of linguistic variation in a pilot corpus of texts, as a basis for specific sampling decisions. The actual construction of a corpus would then proceed in cycles: the original design based on theoretical and pilot-study analyses, followed by collection of texts, followed by further empirical investigations of linguistic variation and revision of the design.},

  abstract = {The question addressed in this study is whether the speed with which a word is recognized depends upon the frequency of related words, and which types of related words have such an influence. For example, does the speed of recognition of the word stair depend at all on the frequency of stairs (an inflectional relative)? Is the speed with which people recognize govern influenced by their knowledge of the word government (a derivational relative)? Is the recognition of fee influenced by the simple fact that the letters overlap with the letters in familiar words such as feet, feed, and feel (nonmorphological relatives)? The authors asked 95 U. S. college students to distinguish stem words from nonwords in a lexical decision task. The stem words were matched for length and individual frequency, but differed substantially in the frequency of their inflectional, derivational, or nonmorphological relatives. The researchers found that the frequency of inflectionally and derivationally related words significantly affected speed and accuracy of recognition of stems; however, these effects were conditioned by the likely age of acquisition for each word, and by the part of speech. Extensive analyses showed that simple letter overlap did not have a significant effect on word recognition. Taken as a whole, the results support the concept of morphologically based word families, that is, the hypothesis that morphological relations between words, derivational as well as inflectional, are represented in the lexicon. /// [French] La pr{\'e}sente recherche vise {\`a} v{\'e}rifier dans quelle mesure la vitesse de reconnaissance des mots est influenc{\'e}e par la fr{\'e}quence des mots associ{\'e}s et dans quelle mesure elle varie en fonction de la nature des relations entre les mots.

Models which assign an independent role to morphemes predict that derivationally suffixed words have both inhibitive and facilitative effects on the reading process. A reading comprehension task was administered to good and poor high-school-age readers to assess their use of both the lexical-semantic and syntactic information provided by morphemes in derivationally suffixed target words. The subjects appeared to use the stem morpheme of a derivationally suffixed word to establish overall sentence meaning but often did not use the syntactic information contained in the derivational suffix. The failure to use syntactic information in the suffix was significantly greater for lower-ability readers than for those reading at or above grade level. The results offer support for morphologically organized models of the lexicon.},

Using the multi-dimensional analytical framework employed in his earlier work, Biber carries out a principled comparison of both synchronic and diachronic patterns of variation across the four languages. Striking similarities as well as differences emerge, allowing Biber to predict for the first time cross-linguistic universals of register variation. This major new work will provide the foundation for the further investigation of cross-linguistic universals governing the pattern of discourse variation across registers, and will be of wide interest to any scholar interested in style, register and literacy.},

  abstract = {Word frequency is the most important variable in research on word processing and memory. Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Ku{\v c}era and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16\textendash{}30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Ku{\v c}era \& Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEXUS corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.},

This study examined the ability of 106 graduate and undergraduate nonnative-English-speaking students to produce appropriate derivatives in the four major word classes (i.e., noun, verb, adjective, and adverb) for 16 prompt words. The results indicated that it was relatively uncommon for subjects to know either all of the four word forms or none of them. Subjects usually had partial knowledge of the derivatives, with productive knowledge of two or three forms being typical. In a comparison of derivational mastery and knowledge of the prompt words on a four-stage developmental scale, the subjects showed increasing knowledge of noun and verb derivatives at each stage, but adjective and adverb forms appeared to be more difficult for them. The results may imply a need for more direct attention to the teaching of derivative forms.},

For analytical purposes it will use a conceptual tool in the form of a multidimensional matrix combining demographic and contextual tiers. The combined demographic and contextual design will be capable of showing the distribution of speech types in various subgroups of the population. The supplementary corpus will include about 10\% of the collected data, and will add to the statistically-sampled corpus some targeted demographically sampled texts and a contextually designed collection. This design is culturally dependent to suit the special structure of the Israeli Hebrew speech community and thus includes both native and non-native speakers of Hebrew. Nonetheless, the principles governing this design are such that they would service study of many other speech communities, to the extent that the design itself may be employed for other corpora with only slight modifications.},

However, differences in translation may also be due to misspellings, incomplete or corrupt data files, or wrongly aligned subtitles. This paper reports our efforts in recognising and classifying alternative subtitle translations with language independent techniques. We use time-based alignment with lexical re-synchronisation techniques and BLEU score filters and sort alternative translations into categories using edit distance metrics and heuristic rules. Our approach produces large numbers of sentence-aligned translation alternatives for over 50 languages provided via the OPUS corpus collection.},

  abstract = {The notion of intonation units is very basic to the study of discourse. Nevertheless, a clear-cut definition of what comprises an intonation unit has not been forthcoming. In reality, it seems that the boundaries delineating intonation units are somewhat easier to define, though this is by no means a closed subject. In this preliminary study of spoken Israeli Hebrew, we took four common criteria for intonation unit boundaries (fast initial speech, slow terminating speech, pitch reset, pauses) and analyzed their occurrences in a segment taken from a spontaneous speech corpus, containing approximately 54 such units. This segment was parsed perceptually by four researchers, and the resultant boundaries were analyzed acoustically to determine which were present at each boundary. A number of interesting conclusions result: only a quarter of the boundaries conformed to all cues, while two boundaries that were agreed upon by all the listeners conformed to none. Final lengthening was most prevalent, followed by pitch reset, then pauses, and finally fast initial speech. A larger study, involving many more units and more speakers is in progress.},

The three experiments test in various ways the lack of access to semantic and syntactic information, as opposed to the expert's segmentation. Results show that quantitatively stronger prosodic cues are needed for informants without access to the syntax-semantics of the sample, especially when they are non-speakers. The analysis also suggests the existence of both universal and language-specific prosodic cues.},

The frequencies are derived from a wide ranging and up-to-date corpus of English: the British National Corpus, which was compiled from over 4,000 written texts and spoken transcriptions representing the present day language in the UK. The book is based on a new version of the corpus (available from 2001) providing more accurate grammatical information, which is essential (for example) for distinguishing words like leaves (noun) and leaves (verb) with different meanings. The book begins with a general introduction, explaining why such information is important and highlighting interesting linguistic findings that emerge from the statistical analysis of the British National Corpus vocabulary. It also contains twenty four 'interest boxes' which highlight and comment on different aspects of frequency - for example, the most common colour words in English in order of frequency, and a comparison of male words (e.g. man) and female words (e.g. woman) in terms of their frequency.},

The results are incompatible with existing models of visual word recognition, which attribute frequency effects directly to frequency, and are particularly problematic for accounts in which frequency effects reflect learning. We argue that the results reflect the importance of likely need in memory processes, and that the continuity between reading and memory suggests using principles from memory research to inform theories of reading.},

Many dispersion measures and adjusted frequency measures have been suggested but are neither widely known nor applied. Another unfortunate aspect of such measures is that many also come with a variety of problems. I pursue three objectives with this article. First, I want to raise awareness of this issue and make the available measures more widely known, so I present an overview of many measures of dispersion and adjusted frequencies. Second, I propose a conceptually simple alternative measure, DP, explain and exemplify it, and compare it to previously discussed measures. Third and most importantly, I urge corpus linguists to explore the notion of dispersion in more detail and outline a few proposals which steps to take next.},

In a previous study, I reviewed many of these measures and suggested an alternative measure, DP (for `deviation of proportions'), which I argued to be conceptually simpler and more versatile than many competing measures. However, despite the relevance of dispersion for virtually all corpuslinguistic work, it is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets, nor is there any work that attempts to determine how different measures match up with the kind of psycholinguistic data that dispersions and adjusted frequencies are supposed to represent.

The property of DC is investigated theoretically and empirically, showing that it is clearly distinguishable from word frequency and range of distribution. DC is also shown to reflect intuitive interpretations, especially when its value is close to 1. Its immediate application in NLP would include defining a core lexicon in a language and identifying topical words in a document. We also categorize the existent measures of dispersion into 3 groups via ratio of norm or entropy, proposed a simplified measure and a combined kind of measure. These new measures can be used as virtual prototype or medium type for the study and comparison of existent measures in the future.},

  doi = {10.1076/jqul.9.3.215.14124},
  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to investigate methods of how to rank words in a way that corresponds to an intuitive notion of `commonness'. Since there is no formal definition of such a notion, our techniques may be considered as a suggestion for such a definition. The commonness of words is sometimes roughly substituted with their frequency in a language corpus. In order to suggest a better measure, we define a quantity, which we call corrected frequency. It depends not only on the frequency of a word in a corpus, but also on its distribution within the corpus. Unlike previous solutions of the same problem, we take the corpus as an uninterrupted sequence of words with no regard to borders between files, texts, genres, or any others. We introduce three different corrected frequencies. Their definitions are based on notions of information theory and analysis of random processes. Their values for individual words depend on the corpus. Hence, it is important to what extent they are stable with respect to the selection of the corpus. In order to investigate the suggested corrected frequencies from that point of view, we compare their values on five different subcorpora of the whole corpus. We present several examples of words taken from the Czech National Corpus that demonstrate in which way the corrected frequencies correspond to the intuitive commonness of these words.},

After describing the rationale behind the NGSL, the specific steps taken to create it and a discussion of the latest 1.01 version of the list, the paper moves on to comparing the text coverage offered by the NGSL against both the GSL as well as another recent GSL published by Brezina and Gablasova (referred to as Other New General Service List [ONGSL] in this paper). Results indicate that while the original GSL offers slightly better coverage for texts of classic literature (about 0.8\% better than the NGSL and 4.5\% more than the ONGSL), the NGSL offers 5{\'A}6\% more coverage than either list for more modern corpora such as Scientific American or the Economist.},

Moreover, there is a high consistency between different individuals as to the ordering of objects in respect of their naming latencies. It is further shown that a high correlation exists between the time taken to name an object and the frequency with which its name occurs in the language as a whole, as estimated in the Thorndike-Lorge Word List. Some implications of these findings are discussed, especially with reference to possible mechanisms by which presented objects are visually identified, and the appropriate names retrieved from the ``word-store.''},

Possible reasons for this are suggested and arguments are presented for why (and how) corpus linguists should look more into the possibilities of complementing their corpus studies with experimental data.},

The most commonly used Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) (Nation, 1983, 1990; Schmitt, Schmitt, \& Clapham, 2001), is limited by a few important factors: a) it does not contain a section which tests the first 1,000-word frequency level; b) the VLT was created from dated frequency lists which are not as representative as newer and larger corpora; and c) the VLT item format is problematic in that it does not support item independence (Culligan, 2015; Kamimoto, 2014) and requires time for some students to understand the directions. To address these issues, the NVLT was created, which can be used by teachers and researchers alike for both pedagogical and research-related purposes.},
