This thesis explains the theory behind the creation of the Conversational Hebrew Vocabulary List (hereafter CHVL)—a Modern Hebrew high-frequency word list—along with implications from the project. The list itself is included as an appendix, and can also be downloaded free of charge in a variety of formats. While evaluating past methods for the creation of such lists, it became clear that a large gap in the literature exists when it comes to less commonly taught languages (LCTLs). Because the overwhelming majority of the previous research in this area has been focused on English alone, some important nuances are yet to be addressed. More often than not, the few non-English word lists that do exist, along with much of the research in vocabulary acquisition, have taken at face value some of the findings of this Anglo-centric<!--correct word here?--> research, often without questioning whether the same methodologies and conclusions apply to different languages.

The present paper is, therefore, an effort to help educators interested in creating and/or using word lists for their own classrooms, for wider dissemination, or simply for general research purposes. In doing so, it will simultaneously provide an overview of some of the key decisions that must be taken into account for such a project, along with key studies on the topic.

The various uses of word frequency lists can be roughly classified into research applications and practical applications. Examples of research applications include traditional linguistic studies that look for common morphological patterns<!--cite some examples here and throughout this paragraph-->, corpus-linguistic studies seeking to understand language through “real world” texts, and psycholinguistic studies that explore connections between a speaker’s mental lexicon and word frequency. Practical applications of word lists include curriculum and textbook planning for language teachers, vocabulary selection for graded readers and dictionaries, and even independent language study. Of course, the line between research and practical applications can be rather fuzzy. Some of the most important studies lie between these two groups, and attempt to answer questions such as: How can vocabulary knowledge be appropriately tested and measured? What is the role of extensive reading (as opposed to intensive reading) in incidental vocabulary acquisition? What level of vocabulary do learners need in order to read extensively for pleasure? What level of vocabulary do learners need in order to succeed in an academic setting? What role does specialized vocabulary play in reaching understanding? These questions and their answers rely heavily on the creation and use of trustworthy word frequency lists. Yet due to the resources and effort required to create these lists, they are rarely found in languages other than English.

The theoretical foundation for the creation and use of word frequency lists rests on the observation, made popular by the linguist George Kingsley Zipf in the 1930s and 40s, that if one were to create a frequency list of words in a large enough text, the first word would occur roughly twice as often as the second word, three times as often as the third word, and so on (Zipf 1935, 1949). This exponential distribution is significant because it means that a small number of words make up the bulk of a text, whereas the majority of the words occur very few times. Paul Nation, one of the most influential scholars in the field of vocabulary acquisition, has pointed out that Zipf’s Law—as it is has come to be known—can serve as motivation to language learners and teachers, since learning the most common vocabulary in a language covers so much of the communication that naturally occurs (2001).

The primary research question guiding this project is this: *What are the most-frequently used words in conversational Modern Hebrew?* The resulting study also addresses the following secondary research questions, which were necessary to address in order to answer the aforementioned question: *What effect does a corpus of unvocalized texts have on the identification of word families in the computerized creation of a vocabulary frequency list? What factors affect the way that boundaries are demarcated for various levels of word families in Modern Hebrew?* And finally: *What implications might these findings have for word list creation and use as it pertains to other less commonly taught languages?*

The literature review will serve as a basis for many of the important decisions taken during the creation of the CHVL. These decisions—surrounding both corpus and list creation—along with their reasoning, will be explained further in an analysis of the literature. For the sake of clarity, these decisions are listed here at the outset. They are as follows:

**Corpus design**
- *Size:*
- *Text types:* The corpus consists of a single text type: conversation. This is to best fit with the list’s intended audience. In order to accomplish this, movie and television subtitles compose the core of the corpus.<!--add brief explanation of source of subtitles, etc here-->
**List design:**
- *Use:* The primary intended audience for the CHVL is composed of beginning-to-low-intermediate learners of Hebrew as a foreign language. It is designed for both receptive and productive language use.
- *Word family levels:*  The word family level that is best suited for the CHVL’s intended audience is the lemma.<!--add brief explanation of word family levels here-->
- *Criteria:* The CHVL was created using exclusively objective criteria, meaning that it is the product of calculations, and it was not manually tweaked in any way. The empirical criteria used were frequency and range.<!--add brief explanation of frequency and range here-->

Following the review of literature and explanation of theory, the process of the CHVL’s creation will be explained in detail, along with findings from the project. Possible implications for other less commonly taught languages will then be discussed. Finally, the full CHVL will be provided as an appendix.
