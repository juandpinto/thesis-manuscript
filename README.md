# Juan Pinto's MA Thesis Manuscript

This private repository houses the current state of my Master's thesis. If you are seeing this, it's because I've granted you access to it (I hope). I plan to make this repository public after the thesis is complete and housed in the University of Texas archives. My reasoning for using GitHub is to provide an open record of my process for whoever may be interested.

**Some important links:**

- The latest compilation of the PDF can be found in [output/thesis.pdf](output/thesis.pdf).
- I have created a separate (public) repository for all my code and for the word list itself, [here](https://github.com/juandpinto/opus-lemmas).

I am writing this entire thesis in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). All of the individual *.md* files can be found in the [source/](source/) folder. My file structure and makefile follow a modified version of [@tompollard](https://github.com/tompollard)'s [phd-thesis-markdown](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown) repository. The compilation is handled by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
